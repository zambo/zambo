## About

I've been building web applications and solving technical problems for many years. Recently left my role as co-founder and lead developer at a digital agency because I realized what I actually want to do is code full-time rather than split my time between technical and business responsibilities.

Whether it's crafting pixel-perfect user interfaces, carefully leveraging browser events to capture the right analytics data, or building custom dashboards that actually make sense, I'm happiest when I can dive into pure technical challenges. My wife (a PhD environmental engineer) calls what I do "staring at colorful letter soup." She's... probably not wrong. Here's [my nvim config](https://github.com/zambo/dotfiles/tree/main/nvim/.config/nvim) so you can judge for yourself.

Nowadays I write mainly React with TypeScript, but I'm comfortable with other stacks as well. I know CSS almost inside and out[^1], which is probably why I'm obsessed with getting those pixel-perfect interfaces just right.

[^1]: Thanks to my Internet Explorer vs Firefox days, back when Chrome hadn't been born yet, Firebug, and the most insane cross-browser bugs I've seen back then.

**Tech Stack**: React • TypeScript • Next.js • Vitest/Jest • Unit & E2E Testing • Google Analytics/GTM • Performance Optimization
